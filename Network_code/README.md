Note that it is <i>not</i> the code used in the <u><a href='http://www.scallop-consortium.com/scallop_pathways/'>newer trans-pQTL network interface</a></u>, which was created by <u><a href='https://www.intomics.com/'>Intomics</a></u> and is documented in the supplementary information of <u><a href='https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.03.023804v1'>the 2020 paper</a></u>.
