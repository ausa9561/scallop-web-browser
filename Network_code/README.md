# Network code

This is the code behind the Network analysis in our <u><a href='http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1006706'>2017 paper</a></u>. It is kept here for documentation purposes. Note that it is <i>not</i> the code used in the <u><a href='http://www.scallop-consortium.com/scallop_pathways/'>newer trans-pQTL network interface</a></u>, which was created by <u><a href='https://www.intomics.com/'>Intomics</a></u>
