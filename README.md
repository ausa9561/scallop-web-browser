# Scallop


## Network code


The two network algorithms used and refered in the [2017 pQTL study](http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1006706) can be found in the folder Network_code.




## Browsing interface

The browsing interface consists of cis, trans, and downloads sections - in folders named as dna_region, protein_centric and downloads, respectively. The data is derived  from our [2017 pQTL study on the Improve cohort](http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1006706) and current [SCALLOP meta analysis](https://www.olink.com/scallop/), folders and modules marked accordingly. If in doubt, use the newer SCALLOP-data. The Improve data modules are kept for legacy reasons and data-conservation.
