# Scallop web-browser

This repository contains the code for the Scallop web-browser. Note, this is not the analysis code for the Scallop CVD1 projcet, which will be released on publication. This code merely runs the web-interface found at <u><a href='http://www.scallop-consortium.com/'>www.scallop-consortium.com/</a></u>






## Browsing interface

The browsing interface consists of cis, trans, and downloads sections - in folders named as dna_region, protein_centric and downloads, respectively. The data is derived  from our [2017 pQTL study on the Improve cohort](http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1006706) and current [SCALLOP meta analysis](https://www.olink.com/scallop/), folders and modules marked accordingly. If in doubt, use the newer SCALLOP-data. The Improve data modules are kept for legacy reasons and data-conservation.



## Network code


For historical/documentation purposes, the two network algorithms used and refered in the [2017 pQTL study](http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1006706) can also be found in the folder Network_code. These are otherwise un-related to the scallop-project.
